# My dotfiles

I am using nvim as my daily driver for a long time now and this is an attempt to make my dev environment more portable.

I try to keep my dev environment and configuration barebones, so it should be quite easy to follow and get started with. Feel free to give it a try :slightly_smiling_face: !

I will also try my best to update these files and add more of them if I find anything useful.

## Additional notes
- I now use Ghostty as my goto terminal emulator. 

- I also use [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) in my setup but with almost no additional configuration, so for now I shall not add it here.
